Inverted Pendulum is a classic reinforcement learning problem which we have solved using DQN algorithm.

LOGIC BEHIND INVERTED PENDULUM PROBLEM

State (Observation): [cart position, cart velocity, pole angle,
pole angular velocity]
Action Space: 0 = push left, 1 = push right
Reward: +1 per time step the pole stays upright (CartPole).
Termination: 1)Pole falls too far (angle threshold crossed)
2)Cart moves off-screen
 3)Max steps reached
Physics Logic: The system uses Newtonâ€™s laws to update
motion. Pole tends to fall due to gravity, and the agent must learn
how to balance it by moving the cart left or right.
RL Loop: 1)Observe current state
 2)Take action (force)
 3)Receive next state + reward
 4)Repeat to learn a policy that balances the pole
